## Uneathen Olaberos
Raised by a chaotic good Arch Fey (who also has warlocks roaming the Prime Material), after his village was slaughtered 
during a spat between cultists of Devils, Demons and the Gods, Uneathen roams the deep forests, plains and underdark
ensuring that portals to both Good and Evil plains are sealed shut, or at least inaccessible to the denizens thereof.
His hate for the extremes of ideology burns deep in him and he only longs for the stability and neutrality of a boring 
life that he will never know, protecting the inhabitants of the prime material from the horrors of the light and dark 
alike. The Fey, in his eyes, get a pass, their venturing into the prime material are as mundane and short lived as the
people who dwell here. The immediate lives of the people in the Prime material are of no concern to him, only the continued
existence of the mundane and his protectorate of it drive him forward. And necromancers, fuck those guys.
