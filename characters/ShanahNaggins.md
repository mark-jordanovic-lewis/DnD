## Race
Shanah is a forest gnome. She has taken it upon herself to be guardian of the forest where she and her tribe live and work. She is as artisinal as all gnomes but has spent her time acquiring the skills to mislead, confuse, bedazzle and rip off any who wander into her realm.

Woe betide those who do not pay the tax of entering the tribes domain without prior consent, good reason or simply for traffic trough this region may not be cheap. It may not cost you your life but your dignity and possessions are certainly up for grabs.

A master of woodworking, carving and mischief Shanah gleefully arranges illusory and real waypoints, mazes and loops around a person to confuse and humiliate until a creeping insanity forces them to surrender what she has deemed necessary payment for passage. All this goes back to the tribe, of course. Well most of it, Shanah needs her cut too, it's hard work being the local Pan.

## Background
<b>Mulmaster Aristocrat</b>
She believes she is a forest noble, that the forest is her mansion and home and she displays a haughty attitude to people who believe otherwise. The forest supplies everything anyone would ever need and why would one trap oneself in a dusty, germ filled house when the fresh breezes, cool streams and shady copses are all around you? Other peoples wallets are her own to tax simply for their presence in the forest and she takes what she, and by extension the forest as the tribe is its guardian, desires.

- Fucked with an oakheart guard so he has a vendatta
  - stories in oakheart about a trickster fey (disguise self) in the forest
- Stowed away on the boat as the party did not pay the tax in her woods. She was busy taxing someone else at the time - the guards did not appreciate that...

<b>Proficiencies</b>


<b>Artisans tools</b>
- Woodworking tools

<b>Musical Instruments</b>
- Shawm with detachable bellows (gnomish plus background)
- Thelarr (self made with woodworking tools)

## Traits
I will not admit I am wrong if I can help it, and why would I be wrong? This is _my_ forest. I set the rules. If you are wrong and I am right, who's to blame about the facts, really?

## Ideals
I am concerned with the fortunes of my family, friends and forest. Others must see to themselves. Family and those who I hold a debt to is a flexible concept, as is those who hold a debt to me. They can be interchangeable when the need suits me or my tribe.

## Bonds
I have dedicated my wealth and talents to the service of the tribe and forest, and your wealth is my wealth because this is my forest and you are in it.

## Flaws
The ends (protecting the forest and making the tribe wealthy) justify the means - up to a point, of course, I mean, it depends on the end, you know? So what, he's just hungry I left him some jerky and a ... a.. _kiiiind of_ map. He'll be fine.
