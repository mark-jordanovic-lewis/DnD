## Story and Background
Clerina comes from a large rich family of brewers that came into money originally from her great grandfather being an expert forger (of 
artworks) and smuggler. Clerinas parents had many children who took up the family trade and the consuption thereof, leading to some disgraces (but not losing wealth). After some bad behaviour from Clerinas older brothers her mother and fatehr decided they would begin sending their children to monastaries to be brought up under the eyes of various gods. Clerina has been in a religious order for most of her formative years - from the age of 12 to now, where she has been sent out to learn the ways of the world and help where she may.
